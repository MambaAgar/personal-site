  			</div>

  			<div class="row">
  				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h3>First Coding Experience</h3>
					<p class="center">
  						The first developer environment I used was Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express because
  						first language I <i>tried</i> to learn was C++ using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1D10C030FDCE7CE0">
						this tutorial series</a>. I'm not criticising the tutorial series, but I think I was about 12 years
						old at the time so I'll leave you to guess how that went! I've embedded the first programming tutorial I ever
						watched if you're interested:
					</p>
					<center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tyVhn0FWWB4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br>
					<p class="center">
						I chose C++ at first because at the time I
						knew of nothing that I could compare it to in terms of its syntax and general suitability for beginners.
						That is why I soon switched to Python as my go to language. To this day I think it is a great language.
  					</p>
  				</div>
  				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h3>First Computer</h3>
					<p class="center">
  						The first computer I owned was a Dell Inspiron B130 (which was old at the time) and I
						thought it was broken at first because the battery was flat and barely held its charge!
						When I obtained the device, it only had a mere 256MB of RAM - so it quickly became the
						victim of my first RAM upgrade! I maxed it out with a mighty 2GB of Crucial memory. The
						difference was really night and day.
  					</p>
					<img src="images/laptop.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Laptop"/>
					<p class="center">
						That was when I first started to fall in love with computer science - I would spend hours on Gimp (a
						free version of Photoshop) editing and creating accounts on any and almost all websites I came across so
						that I could experience the true power of the Web 2.0 (a.k.a. "the interactive web") and I've been loving
						it ever since. Yes, I'm a geek. I know.
					</p>
  				</div>
  				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h3>First Real Project</h3>
					<p class="center">
						The first piece of software that I wrote that actually had any real substance in
						my opinion was <a href="#grapher">my graphing utility</a>.
						I mainly just used <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> and
						<a href="http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml">pygame</a>. Later on I reused and enhanced
						the software substantially as part of my A level computing coursework.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						I decided to rewrite it from the ground up due to the quantity of documentation that was required as
						well as there being many things I wanted to do differently.

  					<h3>Guido Van Rossum Tribute Page</h3>
  					<p class="center">
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido Van Rossum</a>, for those of you that don't already know, invented the Python programming language.
						It also happens to be the first programming language I learned as well as the best overall language
						for beginners to learn in my opinon. Not everyone deserves their own tribute page, but this man
						<i>certatinly</i> does!
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						Now granted, this was one of the very first projects I ever made and as a result you can see that its
						extremely simple. That said, it does demonstrate that even back when I made that project I could effectively
						use <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a> to make a simple web page very fast (it took only about
						30 minutes or so). I do also like to leave this up for people to see as a demonstration that everyone has to
						start somewhere!

					<h3>Flip Crash</h3>
  					<p class="center">
						I really enjoyed making this app because it was one of my first real ventures in to the world of mobile game development.
						I have encourporated Game Center leaderboards so it uses your Apple ID to connect with your Game Center friends and that
						then allows you to compare high scores and see where you stand in the world rankings.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						It was a priority for me right from the start of this project to make sure that it was optimised and worked well for
						both iPhone <i>and</i> iPad. Personally, even though iOS does now do a good job with upscaling unoptimised apps I'd
						certainly rather this app not be one of them.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						I hope you enjoy playing this game, and if you don't then at least you'll probably have beaten my highscore!

  					<h3>Personal Graphing Utility</h3>
  					<p class="center">
						This was a Python project that I built for fun to be able to graph common mathematical equations in a nice intuitive way
						and with a simple but functional user interface and user experience.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						I personally think that anyone should be able to have their very own graphing utility which they can customise however they'd like.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						This was a really neat project and I showcase this one
						in particular because I remember it specifically for it being the one where I finally began to understand what it meant to
						write great, object-oriented code in a practical environment to accomplish a specific task.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						I believe I am one of many developers who believe that everything within reason should be open source. So in the support of
						the brilliant open source programming community, you can see this project on GitHub.

                  What are your favourite resources or recommendations for beginners who want to learn to write code?

                <div class="panel-body">
                  	<p>
					I think that the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python">Python course on Codecademy</a>
					  is a fantastic place to start because you don't have to download anything and it really seems to
					  guide you through the process, even offering hints for when you get stuck.
			  		</p>
					<p>
						If for some reason you'd prefer not to learn Python, my second language of choice for beginners would
						be <a href="http://www.javascript.com">JavaScript</a>. This is now commonly referred to as "the universal
						language of the web" becuase of its mass adoption by many major tech companies and professionals,
						as well as the fact that all modern browsers can understand and run it. Web development is the place to be
						these days, but you can of course do web development in Python as well.
					</p>
					<p>
				  If you feel a little more confident, or want to try writing some code outside of the browser, I
				  think that YouTube is the best resource by far. Specifically, my favourite series is called
				  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M">Python 3 Basics Tutorial Series</a>
				  which is by a guy called Harrison Kinsley. He also does some much more advanced tutorials which I
				  also love. I should probably add that I'm not affiliated with him or his site in any way. Some other good
				  tutorials for Python are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_">here</a>,
				  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA">here</a> and
				  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpPG0bKHYKc">here</a>.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			  	With all that said, just because I learnt Python first does not mean that you have to as well. Technologies are
				changing all the time and tomorrow there may well be something even better for beginners than what I have suggested.
				Honestly though, I wouldn't spend too much time choosing a language because if you just pick one and manage to learn
				how to program (which won't happen overnight, so just keep working at it if you haven't got there yet) using that language
				then 90% of the skills you've learnt will be transferrable to any other popular language. So the bottom line - choose a
				language and stick with it until you can code.
			  </p>
			  <p>
			  	Just a final sidenote; <strong><i>if you find projects to work on that you are really passionate about, you will learn much faster</i></strong> and much more
				easily than if you were to think about programming like you do your other tedious work that you've been putting off for ages.

						Erm... no. I did do a Russian GCSE in secondary school though and I thought that it would have been a complete waste of
	  				  time if I didn't carry it on so long story short <i>I do</i> like to read, write and learn Russian when I can but I am still a terrible
	  				  Russian speaker and I can't understand actual Russian people because they speak so fast! Seriously, I swear they speak faster
	  				  in general than native English speakers do.
					</p>
				  <p>
				  	That said, I love the language and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to expand and diversify their skill set. I made
					<a href="http://www.writerussian.wordpress.com">a Russian blog</a> where I attempt to write in Russian occasionally. Sorry in advance if
					I haven't updated that in a while because I am ridiculously slow at typing in Russian on an English keyboard and I find that rather
					frustrating, so that's mainly why. If you
					want to learn with me, <a href="http://www.writerussian.wordpress.com/resources">check out these resources</a>.
